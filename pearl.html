      <span id="j0" class="passage0" data-type="t" data-idnum="0">For two days she has grieved, carrying her dead calf on her head, unwilling to let it go. </span> <span id="j1" class="passage0" data-type="t" data-idnum="1">The mother, a member of the critically endangered southern resident family of orcas, gave birth to her calf Tuesday only to watch it die within half an hour. </span> 
      <span id="j2" class="passage0" data-type="t" data-idnum="2">All day, and through the night, she carried the calf. </span> 
      <span id="j3" class="passage0" data-type="t" data-idnum="3">She was seen still carrying the calf on Wednesday by Ken Balcomb, founder and principal investigator of the Center for Whale Research. </span>
      <span id="j4" class="passage0" data-type="t" data-idnum="4">“It is unbelievably sad,” said Brad Hanson, wildlife biologist with the Northwest Fisheries Science Center. </span> 
      <span id="j5" class="passage0" data-type="t" data-idnum="5">"As a parent, you can only imagine what kinds of emotional stress these animals must be under, having these events happen,” the biologist commented. </span>
      <span id="j6" class="passage0" data-type="t" data-idnum="6">“It reflects the very strong bonds these animals have." </span> 
      <span id="j7" class="passage0" data-type="t" data-idnum="7">It was obvious the calf had not been dead very long, the umbilical cord was still visible. </span>
      <span id="j8" class="passage0" data-type="t" data-idnum="8">The mother carrys her calf by balancing it on her rostrum, just over her nose. She dives to pick it back up every time it slides off. </span>
      <span id="j9" class="passage0" data-type="t" data-idnum="9">Scientists have documented grieving behavior in other animals with close social bonds. </span>
      <span id="j10" class="passage0" data-type="t" data-idnum="10">In one instance, a researcher attached a rope to the carcass of a bottlenose dolphin and towed it to shore—</span> 
      <span id="j11" class="passage0" data-type="t" data-idnum="11">the mother followed, touching the carcass until the water was too shallow to keep going. </span>
      <span id="j12" class="passage0" data-type="t" data-idnum="12">There she remained, watching. </span>
      <span id="j13" class="passage0" data-type="t" data-idnum="13">Some carry their young in their mouths, some on their backs. </span> 
      <span id="j14" class="passage0" data-type="t" data-idnum="14">“All mother's grieve, yes, but I have never heard of this,” the researcher said. “More than 24 hours. </span> 
      <span id="j15" class="passage0" data-type="t" data-idnum="15">It is horrible. This is an animal that is a sentient being. It understands the social bonds that it has with the rest of its family members," she said. </span> 
      <span id="j16" class="passage0" data-type="t" data-idnum="16">"She carried the calf in her womb from 17 to 18 months, she is bonded to it and she doesn’t want to let it go. It is that simple. She is grieving." </span> 
      <span id="j17" class="passage0" data-type="t" data-idnum="17">The southern residents face at least three known challenges to their survival as a species: </span> 
      <span id="j18" class="passage0" data-type="t" data-idnum="18">Toxins, vessel traffic and </span> 
      <span id="j19" class="passage0" data-type="t" data-idnum="19">lack of food.  </span> 
      <span id="j20" class="passage0" data-type="t" data-idnum="20">When they are hungry, it makes their other problems worse, research has shown. </span> 
      <span id="j21" class="passage0" data-type="t" data-idnum="21">For researchers who work closely with the southern residents, their continued decline is painfully apparent. </span> 
      <span id="j22" class="passage0" data-type="t" data-idnum="22">It is said other members of the whale’s family knew the mother was pregnant, because of their echolocation ability, which they use to find food. </span> 
      <span id="j23" class="passage0" data-type="t" data-idnum="23">The researcher looked the reporter in the eye, “So they must be grieving, too.” </span>

    <!--<p align="right" class="bodygreensm">I tried to write a story about a sea cucumber and somehow it turned into the beginning of a story about a valley that used to be an ocean which then became a story about a sister who ran away and a sister who stayed. The sister who ran away writes lists of possible deaths on the back of lawn mowing service fliers to prevent those deaths from happening. Jim Andrews wrote some wicked cool code that I borrowed to help me hide the voice of the disappeared under the voice of the ever searching.</p></td>-->

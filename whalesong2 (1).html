  <!--<p align="center" class="bodyred">In August of 2018, I was sailing up the Pacific Northwest with my mother on a cruise to Alaska. It was the first time we had spent more than a few days together for almost a decade. Our relationship riddled with past pain we pushed back for these two weeks at sea to celebrate her 70th birthday. As we sailed through Washington waters, news broke that an orca mother, J35, had been sighted swimming with a dead calf balanced on her nose for over 24 hours. As our days at sea progressed, the news of J35's parallel journey followed us up the coast. Orca mothers have been known to grieve for their lost young, but never for this long. Seventeen days later, J35's calf slid off her nose somewhere off the coast of Canada, and when J35 resurfaced after several minutes later, she was alone. During those two weeks at sea, I spent hours on deck with binoculars pointed out to sea, searching for J35 and her grief that seemed so embedded within my own relationship with my mother. I made no sighting. 

J35 gave birth to a female calf on July 24, my mother's birthday. The baby orca died only a few minutes later. Keeping the calf’s lifeless body afloat atop her head, J35 kept her grief afloat, swimming through choppy seas for more than two weeks.</p></td>-->
